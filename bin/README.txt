Lab section: MW 6h15 - 7h30
Project: 1
Description: 
 - There are a lot of classes, mostly taken from previous labs, so 
 the only one that actually matters is the Calculator class, which does
 everything
 
 - I have also finished the two EXTRA CREDIT (described at the start of the Calculator class)

 - There are also two files named infix_expr_short.txt (which contains infix expressions)
 and my_eval.txt (which Calculator class will write the results into)
 
 -Also, since I have yet to figure out the problem with my java jdk path and command prompt
 (which I hope that you would understand), I just wrote the name of the files in the argument
 in 'run configurations, which looks like this: src/infix_expr_short.txt src/my_eval.txt. 
 It works so I hope that's okay.
 
 - Another thing, I have added a few more expressions in the infix_expr_short.txt file
 to test the extra credits
