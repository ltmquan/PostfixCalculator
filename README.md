# PostfixCalculator
A project about postfix calculator algorithm

Description: 
 - There are a lot of classes, but the only one that actually matters
 is the Calculator class, which does everything

 - There are also two files named infix_expr_short.txt (which contains infix expressions)
 and my_eval.txt (which Calculator class will write the results into)
